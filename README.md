# AIOps Observability Portfolio

A hands-on AIOps lab built on a Synology NAS that combines open-source observability (Grafana LGTM + OpenTelemetry) with enterprise platforms (Dynatrace, Splunk, ServiceNow).  It demonstrates modern SRE/AIOps practices, including monitoring, alerting, incident automation, ChatOps integrations, Infrastructure as Code, and anomaly detection.

---

## 🚀 Capabilities
- **Open-Source Baseline**: Grafana, Prometheus/Mimir, Loki, Tempo, OpenTelemetry.
- **Enterprise Observability**: Dynatrace OneAgent, Splunk HEC ingestion, ServiceNow integration.
- **Alerting & Collaboration**: Slack + Teams + ServiceNow webhooks, optional Alertmanager.
- **Closed-Loop Automation**: FastAPI listener that creates incidents and performs remediation.
- **IaC**: Ansible for on-prem automation, Terraform for AWS Free Tier (S3, Lambda, CloudWatch).
- **Kubernetes (K3s)**: Workload deployment, Helm charts, OTel Collector DaemonSet.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Python container with Isolation Forest / Moving Average on metrics.
- **Portfolio Polish**: Architecture docs, SLO policies, cost/ROI analysis, screenshots, training video.

  participant Detect as "Monitoring (Grafana/Dynatrace/Splunk)"
  participant Chat as "ChatOps (Slack/Teams)"
  participant ITSM as "ServiceNow"
  participant Auto as "Auto-Remediation (FastAPI Listener)"

  App->>Detect: Error spike / high latency / log pattern
  Detect->>Chat: Send alert (summary + link to dashboard)
  Detect->>ITSM: Create Incident (webhook)
  Chat->>Auto: (Optional) Command/Button triggers remediation
  Auto->>App: Restart container / scale deployment
  Auto->>ITSM: Update Incident with remediation note
  Detect->>Chat: Resolution / Recovery notification
```
